  "source_description": "this  feature is meant as an \"emergency\" release on the 0.10.x release to clean up constitution handling. I want to do this feature before we merge the .worktrees/010 feature introducing isolated worktrees per wp. This feature has several goals. 1) to segregate the spec kitty code, including all templates, from the spec kitty artifacts that are created from spec-kitty init and spec kitty usage. This should lead to this repo being a safe environment in which to use spec kitty whilst developing spec kitty. Here is the analysis from an independent auditor that mirrors your analysis above: Constitution Source - The constitution that ships with every GitHub/tag release and PyPI package lives under .kittify/memory/constitution.md in the main repo. During packaging, Hatch force-includes .kittify/memory/**/* (see pyproject.toml:85-110), so whatever sits in that file at release time becomes the canonical constitution delivered to end users. Installations created via spec-kitty init copy the packaged .kittify/memory/constitution.md into the new project; local editable installs instead source the same path from the repo root. Dev vs. Release Artifacts - When developing Spec Kitty inside this repo, feature worktrees under .worktrees/... don't duplicate the constitution—they symlink or copy .kittify/memory from the main checkout (src/specify_cli/core/worktree.py:269-320). That means edits you make while dogfooding immediately change the sole copy in .kittify/memory/constitution.md, which is exactly what the release pipeline bundles. There isn't a second \"project-specific\" constitution inside the worktree; they all point to the same file, so there's no risk of accidentally packaging a different, worktree-only variant. The only caveat is intentional: if you customize the constitution here, those edits will ship in the next release, so keep the file in a release-ready state or gate changes behind branches until they're ratified. What happens if you release now - The file at /Users/robert/Code/spec-kitty/.worktrees/010-workspace-per-work-package-for-parallel-development/.kittify/memory/constitution.md is that same shared copy. If you built and published the CLI today, the resulting wheel/sdist would include this exact Jujutsu-focused constitution (version 1.0.0, amended 2026‑01‑07). Every downstream spec-kitty init would receive it, and templates/commands referencing the constitution would reflect the same content. No additional automation overwrites it during release, so whatever is committed at that path is what goes out.  Goal #2) to re-think the constitution to be more inline with the suggestions in https://github.com/Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty/issues/72 (and also to fix https://github.com/Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty/issues/72 Goal #3) to fix https://github.com/Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty/issues/71 Goal #4) to fix https://github.com/Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty/issues/70",
