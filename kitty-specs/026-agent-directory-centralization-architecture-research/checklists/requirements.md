# Specification Quality Checklist: Agent Directory Centralization Architecture Research

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on research questions and expected outcomes
- [x] Written for stakeholders (clear research goals and deliverables)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Research requirements are specific and measurable
- [x] Success criteria are clearly defined
- [x] All expected deliverables are documented (decision-framework.md, architecture-proposal.md, feasibility-study.md, recommendation.md)
- [x] Workflow patterns are clearly enumerated (all 6 patterns)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (in-scope, out-of-scope, boundaries)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Research Readiness

- [x] Primary research question is specific and answerable
- [x] Sub-questions decompose the primary question logically
- [x] Research methodology is appropriate for the question type
- [x] Data sources are identified and accessible
- [x] Analysis approach is clearly defined
- [x] Evidence tracking mechanism specified (source-register.csv, evidence-log.csv)
- [x] Deliverable structure is detailed

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All research requirements have clear success criteria
- [x] Workflow patterns cover primary use cases
- [x] Research meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
- [x] Constraints and assumptions are explicitly documented

## Notes

**Validation Status**: ✅ PASSED (All items complete)

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive scope covering all 6 workflow patterns and 14 agents
- Clear deliverable structure (multi-document suite)
- Evidence-based approach with tracking mechanisms
- Explicit backwards compatibility constraint (CRITICAL)
- Well-defined research methodology (multi-method study)

**Readiness**: Specification is complete and ready for `/spec-kitty.plan` phase.

**Next Steps**:
1. Proceed to `/spec-kitty.plan` to create research methodology plan
2. Generate tasks for each deliverable (decision-framework, architecture-proposal, feasibility-study, recommendation)
3. Begin systematic workflow analysis and architecture design
