  "source_description": "I want to add a \"documentation\" mission to spec kitty. I want us to research the state of the art best practices for writing software product documentation and then conceive of a set of tempaltes, commands and workflow that would let us do a documentation mission on a software project. For example, we'll dogfood this to rewrite spec kitty docs themselves. It should study https://www.writethedocs.org/index.html and make those people happy and it should know about the https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/ four types of documentation. Additionally, it should know how generated docs of common natures operate, eg generated docs from various languages and frameworks. You recommend which ones but include JS, Python, Rust for sure.",
