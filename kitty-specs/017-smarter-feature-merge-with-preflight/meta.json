  "source_description": "Improve the spec-kitty merge command based on post-mortem feedback from features 016 and 002. Key pain points: uncommitted changes blocking merge, sequential merge amplifying conflicts, no conflict forecast, manual cleanup required, no resume capability. Focus on git-first improvements with non-invasive status file handling.",
